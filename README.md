# WeatherAndForecasting
The Weather Forecast Command-Line Tool is a Python-based utility that allows users to obtain the current weather forecast for a specific city. Using the API we can provide real-time weather information such as the description of the weather, temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and wind status.
